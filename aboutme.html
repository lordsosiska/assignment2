				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, my name is Leyla and this is About me page, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.

				<h3>More About Me</h3>
				<p>I
					I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. I'm highly energetic and motivated person. I am talkative and sociable.
				</p>
				<p>
                    The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.
